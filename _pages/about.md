About me
======
Lina Luo is an incoming Assistant Professor at the CNCC, HKUST (GZ). She earned her Ph.D. in Environmental Engineering from Rice University in 2023 and conducted postdoctoral research at The Chinese University of Hong Kong.
Dr. Luo’s research focuses on ecosystem–atmosphere interactions, with particular emphasis on the complex responses of agroecosystems to climate change and air quality. Her work integrates perspectives from agroecosystem science, atmospheric science, and environmental management, with a particular focus on soil biogeochemical processes. She advances the development and regional-scale application of process-based models for atmospheric research and provides insights to support region-tailored sustainable agriculture that achieves higher yields with lower pollution and enhanced climate benefits. Her main research areas include agricultural emissions estimation, agriculture–atmosphere feedbacks, and agroecosystem model development. She has established an integrated assessment framework that consistently and mechanistically estimates reactive nitrogen emissions at high spatiotemporal resolution, assesses their impacts on climate and air quality, and evaluates the dynamic responses of soil processes to different farming practices. Her studies reveal the synergies and trade-offs among multiple environmental benefits of sustainable farming strategies. Her work has been published in journals such as Environmental Science & Technology, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, Environment International, Journal of Environmental Management, and Biochar.
